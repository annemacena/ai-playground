<html><body><mark>Called Laila by Morroco and Tura by Spain, the island is claimed by both countries as their
territory. </mark>Battered by strong winds and waves, and more than 80 km away from the nearest
land, the island has only a handful of inhabitants. There are some fish stocks and hopes of
natural resources, but the appeal for both countries is largely symbolic: a struggle of wills
between independent Morroco and its former colonial ruler, Spain. <mark>Both Morroco and Spain insist they have long-standing historical ties to the island. </mark>Morroco
says Laila was recognized as Morrocan territory in 1640, after a run-in between Morrocan
and Spanish fishing boats. <mark>The island was formally placed under the jurisdiction of Morroco
in 1890 but was annexed by Spain in | 900, just before Spain’s colonization of the Morrocan
peninsula. </mark><mark>Morroco asserts Laila was rightly restored to Morroco after World War Il, and a
Morrocan coastguard detachment has been stationed there since 1947 “Laila is an integral
part of Morrocan territory historically, geographically, and under international law,”
Morrocan government argues. </mark>However, Spain claims that it established sovereignty over the island by the mid 17 century
when Spanish sailors used the zone as a port and a fishing ground. <mark>Spain incorporated the
island in 1900. </mark><mark>Spain contends that Morocco Republic acts illegally because the island was
not mentioned in the Algeria Peace Treaty after World War Il as land to be returned to

Morroco. </mark>“The occupation of Tura by Morroco is an illegitimate behavior undertaken on no
basis of international law,” Spain’s Foreign Ministry says. </body></html>
